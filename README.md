# AuthenticadeNet Smart Contracts

This repository contains the initial set of smart contracts for the AuthenticadeNet platform, designed for identity verification and reputation management. These smart contracts leverage blockchain technology to provide secure, transparent, and efficient solutions.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. IdentityVerification.sol

The `IdentityVerification` contract is responsible for registering and verifying user identities on the blockchain.

#### Functions:
- `registerIdentity(string userID, string publicKey)`: Registers a new identity with a public key.
- `verifyIdentity(string userID)`: Verifies the user's identity based on provided credentials.
- `getIdentityStatus(string userID)`: Retrieves the current verification status of the user.

#### Events:
- `IdentityRegistered(string userID, string publicKey)`: Emitted when a new identity is registered.
- `IdentityVerified(string userID)`: Emitted when an identity is verified.

### 2. ReputationManagement.sol

The `ReputationManagement` contract manages and updates user reputation scores based on their interactions and transactions.

#### Functions:
- `recordTransaction(string userID, string details)`: Records a transaction associated with a user.
- `updateReputation(string userID, uint256 score)`: Updates the user's reputation score based on transaction outcomes.
- `getReputation(string userID)`: Retrieves the user's current reputation score.

#### Events:
- `TransactionRecorded(string userID, string details, uint256 timestamp)`: Emitted when a transaction is recorded.
- `ReputationUpdated(string userID, uint256 score)`: Emitted when a user's reputation score is updated.

## Development Environment

These smart contracts are developed using:

- **Solidity**: For writing smart contracts.
- **Truffle Suite**: For development, testing, and deployment.
- **Hyperledger Fabric**: As the blockchain platform.

## Getting Started

To get started with these smart contracts:

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AuthenticadeNet-SmartContracts.git
